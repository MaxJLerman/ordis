ChatGPT-style interaction with an AI designed to respond & behave with the user as if it was the Cephalon Ordis, the damaged Cephalon programmed to assist the Tenno.

ideas to add:
- calls the user: Operator
- every 10 minutes of inactivity, Ordis will send the user a random [non-situation-specific] message from the wiki page

further ideas after finishing main logic:
- possibility of changing Operator icon to another warframe's
- possibility of changing Ordis into another cephalon/aide seen in Warframe (accompanying personality)
